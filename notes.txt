- convert degrees to radians in next report

- angle time graph -

- release angle from 30 degrees?
- tracker uncertainty
- power series b value using that to determine if it is symmetrical?

If you get 0.003±0.001, it is somewhere between 0.002 and 0.004, which does not contain zero and you can't say it's symmetrical;
If you get 0.001±0.003, it is somewhere between -0.002 and 0.004, which contains zero and you can say it's symmetrical.

have actual values of B, C in a table

or actually (ask ta mable) - what does symmetrical even mean

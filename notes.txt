discuss how largest uncertainty in experiment could be improved on in the future (implicitly mentioning future work)

gotta make it more clear about uncertainties w smth like this:
- t_0 represnets ..., measured to be x+dx
- B represents ..., measured to be y+dy
- C represents ..., measured to be z+dz

units for time and other final results in equations

section 4.1 instead of section 4?

[if have time] embed log log plot into the normal plot

mention how i kept the angle constant for q factor
what should I fit q factor to
q factor table in appendix bc the uncertainties are small
C = how much it affects the angle, etc.

could have been uneven tension force -
if have time for the last report, given the same height, angle of the "v" vs period
measuring period using tracker is much easier than relying on reaction time and also reduces uncertainty

keeping variables the same = only varying one parameter, make sure that no other factors influence my lab

commend on the small angles

==================================================
Stuff for 2nd check in and maybe other stuff for pendulum lab rewrite
==================================================

- based on lab1 conclusion, small angles have minimum effect on period, therefore i release anglees at a small period




==================================================
Notes for next time
==================================================

- convert degrees to radians in next report

- tracker uncertainty
- power series b value using that to determine if it is symmetrical?

If you get 0.003±0.001, it is somewhere between 0.002 and 0.004, which does not contain zero and you can't say it's symmetrical;
If you get 0.001±0.003, it is somewhere between -0.002 and 0.004, which contains zero and you can say it's symmetrical.


reference more graphs in the future

You can't prove the sinusoidal decay is exponential (in fact it is technically not). Here you are just using it as an acceptable model as follows:

At first glance, the angle vs time data appears to follow an exponential damped sinusoidal curve. So to verify this you fit a exponentially damped sinusoidal function to angle vs time data. It turns out the fit is decent (residuals lie within/around error sizes). Hence you claim that exponential decay is a good model for the pendulum's amplitude, and extract the decay factor  from the curve fit to describe the rate of decay.

wtf does a larger uncertainty for q value entail?

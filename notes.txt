discuss how largest uncertainty in experiment could be improved on in the future (implicitly mentioning future work)

gotta make it more clear about uncertainties w smth like this:
- t_0 represnets ..., measured to be x+dx
- B represents ..., measured to be y+dy
- C represents ..., measured to be z+dz

units for time and other final results in equations

section 4.1 instead of section 4?

[if have time] embed log log plot into the normal plot

find necesary references for q factor

- convert degrees to radians in next report

You can't prove the sinusoidal decay is exponential (in fact it is technically not). Here you are just using it as an acceptable model as follows:

At first glance, the angle vs time data appears to follow an exponential damped sinusoidal curve. So to verify this you fit a exponentially damped sinusoidal function to angle vs time data. It turns out the fit is decent (residuals lie within/around error sizes). Hence you claim that exponential decay is a good model for the pendulum's amplitude, and extract the decay factor  from the curve fit to describe the rate of decay.

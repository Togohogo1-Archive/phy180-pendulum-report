- convert degrees to radians in next report

- angle time graph -

- release angle from 30 degrees?
- tracker uncertainty
- power series b value using that to determine if it is symmetrical?

If you get 0.003±0.001, it is somewhere between 0.002 and 0.004, which does not contain zero and you can't say it's symmetrical;
If you get 0.001±0.003, it is somewhere between -0.002 and 0.004, which contains zero and you can say it's symmetrical.

have actual values of B, C in a table

or actually (ask ta mable) - what does symmetrical even mean
reference more graphs in the future

You can't prove the sinusoidal decay is exponential (in fact it is technically not). Here you are just using it as an acceptable model as follows:

At first glance, the angle vs time data appears to follow an exponential damped sinusoidal curve. So to verify this you fit a exponentially damped sinusoidal function to angle vs time data. It turns out the fit is decent (residuals lie within/around error sizes). Hence you claim that exponential decay is a good model for the pendulum's amplitude, and extract the decay factor  from the curve fit to describe the rate of decay.

wtf does a larger uncertainty for q value entail?

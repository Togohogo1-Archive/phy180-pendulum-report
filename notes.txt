100 for q value is optimal for this experiment

Your graph from the first check in (improved perhaps) with the quadratic fit (if you didn't already include that).

Either the sinusoidal theta(t) graph or just the amplitude(t) graph. Either one will show whether your pendulum is decaying exponentially or linearly (or something else, but that would surprise me).

multiple trilas when determining tau and Q factor = do not need

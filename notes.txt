- Section 3 vs 3.2
========================================

where: put or odnt put colon moment

introduce the data
present details on collecting strategies

loop:

    present uncertainty


center of mass is at the center to align with the string

discuss how largest uncertainty in experiment could be improved on in the future (implicitly mentioning future work)

units for time and other final results in equations

section 4.1 instead of section 4?

find necesary references for q factor

the period will change due to drag -> more impact for angle of 60 degrees ngl, also pendulum doesn't behave like an ideal pendulum

expected change in period -> if change in period falls within period uncertainty then i'm gucci

weight of the string is not negligible as the length increases to a craz amo


==================================================
Notes for next time
==================================================

- convert degrees to radians in next report


At first glance, the angle vs time data appears to follow an exponential damped sinusoidal curve. So to verify this you fit a exponentially damped sinusoidal function to angle vs time data. It turns out the fit is decent (residuals lie within/around error sizes). Hence you claim that exponential decay is a good model for the pendulum's amplitude, and extract the decay factor  from the curve fit to describe the rate of decay.

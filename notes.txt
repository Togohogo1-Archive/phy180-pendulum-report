==================================================
about to retake all data for pendulum lab
==================================================
could have been uneven tension force -
if have time for the last report, given the same height, angle of the "v" vs period
measuring period using tracker is much easier than relying on reaction time and also reduces uncertainty

==================================================
Stuff for 2nd check in and maybe other stuff for pendulum lab rewrite
==================================================
How to we calculate Q factor for 2nd graph
- choose from first report
- if they dont then have to justify why one is better than the other
- both methods of determining the Q factor are experimental

Data points for lab 3
- 10 lower bound

Should lab2 be separate from lab 1
- lab 2 using small angles, build a big report now rather than make 2 reports

Graphs for check in 3
- period length
- q-length graphs
- also prepared to tell TA conclusions you can draw from the graphs

- earlier reports showed how you found the Q factor once, then thats all you need, clearly state method of finding Q factor in lab2
    - find out which method of Q value has less uncertainty (how to find the uncertainty by counting)

Log Log graph?
-

if i have an hold version of determining Q factor (larg angle) and i try again, do i need to log it
- fix it in some way?? idk
** i released the pendulum from a large angle for the amplitude-time graph. I want to redo that data, do I include the old stuff innit?
- based on lab1 conclusion, small angles have minimum effect on period, therefore i release anglees at a small period




==================================================
Notes for next time
==================================================
- convert degrees to radians in next report

- angle time graph -

- release angle from 30 degrees?
- tracker uncertainty
- power series b value using that to determine if it is symmetrical?

If you get 0.003±0.001, it is somewhere between 0.002 and 0.004, which does not contain zero and you can't say it's symmetrical;
If you get 0.001±0.003, it is somewhere between -0.002 and 0.004, which contains zero and you can say it's symmetrical.

have actual values of B, C in a table

or actually (ask ta mable) - what does symmetrical even mean
reference more graphs in the future

You can't prove the sinusoidal decay is exponential (in fact it is technically not). Here you are just using it as an acceptable model as follows:

At first glance, the angle vs time data appears to follow an exponential damped sinusoidal curve. So to verify this you fit a exponentially damped sinusoidal function to angle vs time data. It turns out the fit is decent (residuals lie within/around error sizes). Hence you claim that exponential decay is a good model for the pendulum's amplitude, and extract the decay factor  from the curve fit to describe the rate of decay.

wtf does a larger uncertainty for q value entail?

does pendulum length need to be the same for lab 1 and lab 2?

how to Uncertainty for Q value when counting
